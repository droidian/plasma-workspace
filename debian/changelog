plasma-workspace (4:5.0.1-0ubuntu1~ubuntu14.10~ppa6) utopic; urgency=medium

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * New upstream release
  * Add kubuntu_startkde-qtpath.diff to tell it the path to,
    ironically, qtpaths
  * Add depends on frameworkintegration

  [ Scarlett Clark ]
  * Add missing lib to fix build
  * Cleanup - remove -data and minor fixes.
  * Update watch to http://download.kde.org
  * Cleanup copyright-helper cruft.

  [ José Manuel Santamaría Lema ]
  * Build depend on libkf5filemetadata1-dev instead of
    libkf5filemetadata5-dev.
  * Add plasma-workspace.postinst in order to set the x-session-manager
    alternative, this way in a system without any login manager and only
    the plasma desktop installed users would be able to start plasma
    just typing 'startx'.
  * Add plasma-workspace-dbg in order to provide debugging symbols.

  [ Rohan Garg ]
  * Add sddm-theme-breeze package

  [ Harald Sitter ]
  * plasma-workspace relationship adjustments:
     Depends:
     + kde-cli-tools - needed to run screenlocker kcm (standalone that is)
     + kio-extras - needed for wallpaper preview generation
     + milou - needed for qml module used in krunner
     + gdb-minimal | gdb - used by drkonqi
     - libkf5declarative5 - library, should be picked up by shlibs
     - kde-wallpapers-default - kdesc4 package, 5.x wallpaper is in workspace
     - qtquick1-5-dev
     Suggests:
     - libkf5newstuff5 - only contains a lib that should be picked up by shlibs
  * Drop kde-plasma-kf5.desktop as upstream now provides an xsession file
  * Demote sddm dependency of sddm-theme-breeze to recommends. The theme is not
    worthwhile having without sddm to load it, but there is no actual
    dependency, the other way around however sddm-theme-breeze could provided
    sddm-theme to resolve sddm's theme dependency, which then defacto makes a
    circular dependency.

  [ José Manuel Santamaría Lema ]
  * Build depend on libxcb-randr0-dev.
  * Add the following alternative depencies to make plasma-workspace installable
    with latest debian's qt 5.3:
    - qml-module-qtquick2 as an alternative of qtdeclarative5-qtquick2-plugin
    - qml-module-qtquick-window2 as an alternative of qtdeclarative5-window-plugin
  * Improve kubuntu_add-qml2-path.diff so plasma-workspace doesn't need to
    execute dpkg-architecture at runtime.

  [ Scarlett Clark ]
  * add qml-module-qtgraphicaleffects runtime depend
